# Development Log

## January 3, 2025
- Set up the GitHub repository for planning.
- Researched how to export JSON from DND Beyond.
- Created initial ideas for the project features.
## Final thoughts from the day
- I havent found how to get the information from dnd beyond to raw data that is readable.
- API's dont seem avaialable.
- I've tried converting PDFs to JSON files but the results wernt good.
- Im at a bit of a dead end of how to get the information easily without lots of coding every time i want to load a character sheet.
